### Reflection

I looked at a few projects but I ended up choosing Sails as it seemed the most user friendly to run and use. The town hall meeting on April 21st was a great help as Dr. Goggins went through the steps to setting up Sails.

Sails is a web framework with SSO capabilities that is scalabe for Node.js projects. It is also the most widely-used web application frameworks in the world. For this reason, that is why I primarily chose Sails.

Apart from going through the tutorial and reviewing the town hall meeting to get the web app started, I did not go any much deeper into it. At this stage, it is more so a demo to display its capability and functionality.

I did not encounter much obstacles or problems as I had Node.js already installed on my computer.
