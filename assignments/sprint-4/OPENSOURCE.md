### Reflections
After reading the two articles, it gave me a better understanding of how to contribute to an Open Source Software as well as a deeper understanding of its culture. The article posted by The Linux Foundation was especially helpful as the tips given were practical and made sense. It also encourages the reader to try to participate and contribute to an open source project which I just might in the near future.

As for why one would participate in an open source project, there are many potential reasons. In the other article, it highlights that the core motivations to particapation will boil down to either two categories, they are:

1. Extrinsic reasons/motivations
2. Intrinsic reasons/motivations


These factors form the basis as to why one would contribute to an open source project.
Extrinsic motivations for example, are money, promotions and awards. These reasons are externally motivated and we use them to increase our social standings. As an example, a person might contribute to a project to gain experience which can be applied to his/her work, or as a resume builder. These things help one to improve their skill set which makes them more marketable in the future.

Intrinsic motivations which are more interesting as the motivation comes from within. It comes from a number of different sources but the most straightfoward would be because of the simple enjoyment of an activity. A person might want to contribute as the act of contributing to a bigger project gives him/her enjoyment.
