# Reflections

This assignment was rather hard but rewarding. I completed the main objectives of this assignment with the help of online resources and materials provided from the class. Specifically, the video tutorials uploaded by Prof. Goggins was especially useful.

I did encounter a few hiccups along the way when doing the assignment. Many of my issues stem from the fact that I use a Windows machine and many of the commands did not translate and had a different syntax.
For example, when activating a virtual environment I had to refer to https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/ and follow the Window's command.
Also, when attempting to 'make' a dex app, I encountered problems as my minGW was did not have the sqlite3 required to launch the app.
I had to remedy this by downloading tdm64-gcc from https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/, which included it.

In summary, the main challenges I faced during the assignment were caused by technicalities and the smaller details.

My goal is to have a fully functioning web-app with SSO capabilities to display data regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.
