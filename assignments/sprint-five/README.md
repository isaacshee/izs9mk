### Readme
Regrettably, I could not finish my project in time due to these current circumstances and gaps in my knowledge.

Initially, I wanted to create an app that can display COVID-19 statistics and data as well as any current news regarding the virus.
The web app would require an SSO login so that the website would be more secure. I would get my data from public sources such as 
the NY times COVID-19 data repo or the Kaggle COVID-19 Global Forecasting challenge, which gave me my idea.

However, I did manage to create an SSO from previous assignments which is still extremely useful knowledge I attained from the course
aside from being exposed to Software Engineering
