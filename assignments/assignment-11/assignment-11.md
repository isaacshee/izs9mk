## Working group

The working group I plan to attend is the Value working group. I initially wanted to attend the Weekly meeting but missed it.

## Podcast reflections

The podcast gave me valuable insight on how open source communities and projects truly operate and function. Listening to it was beneficial as the hosts gave clear and meaningful points regarding why CHAOSS is valuable and open source projects as a whole.
It was also interesting to hear about the hosts` backgrounds and their experiences as well as the mission of CHAOSS.
